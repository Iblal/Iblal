## Hi I'm Iblal 👋

I've been developing software for the past 5 years. I'm currently building IblalORM, an ORM written in TypeScript, similar to Prisma and Entity Framework. I consider myself technology agnostic but I find myself mostly working with React, Typescript, and NodeJS for web applications.

I have a YT Channel were I share my project demos and tutorials, check it out -> 📺 https://www.youtube.com/@IblalCodes

I'm looking forward to sharing my work and contributing!
